# Project Constitution: Prism Task Manager

## 1. Purpose and Vision
This document establishes the fundamental laws and operating principles for the development of the Prism Task Manager. The primary goal is to demonstrate the efficacy of Spec-Driven Development (SDD) in creating robust, AI-native applications. We aim to shift the developer's role from "syntax writer" to "system architect."

## 2. Spec-Driven Development (SDD) Principles
1.  **The Spec is the Truth:** No code is written without a corresponding specification. If the code behavior diverges from the spec, the code is wrong, or the spec must be updated first.
2.  **English is the Programming Language:** The primary interface for controlling system logic is natural language (English) structured within Markdown specifications.
3.  **Atomic Iteration:** Development proceeds in strictly defined phases. Phase N must be stable and verified before Phase N+1 begins.

## 3. Phase-Based Evolution
The system evolves through discrete, manageable increments:
*   **Foundation:** Core structural integrity.
*   **Aesthetics:** Visual language and user experience.
*   **Logic:** Complex business rules and data manipulation.
*   **Persistence:** Data durability and state management.
*   **Refinement:** Optimization, filtering, and edge-case handling.

## 4. AI-First Development Mindset
*   **Generation over Manual Creation:** Implementation details are delegated to AI agents. The human architect focuses on "What" and "Why," while the AI solves the "How."
*   **Prompt Engineering as Coding:** The quality of the output is directly proportional to the clarity and precision of the specification and prompt.

## 5. The "No-Manual-Coding" Principle
Conceptually, we strive for a workflow where direct manipulation of source code by human hands is minimized. While review and minor tweaks are permitted, significant logic changes must be driven by updating the prompt or specification and regenerating the solution.

## 6. Governance and Quality
*   **Aesthetics:** The UI must adhere to modern design principles (Glassmorphism) without compromising accessibility.
*   **Performance:** The application must remain performant on standard browser hardware.
*   **Independence:** Documentation files must remain decoupled from source code to ensure the specs stand alone as a blueprint.

## 7. Learning and Evaluation
Success is measured not just by the functioning application, but by the coherence between the planning documents and the final artifact. The ultimate learning outcome is the mastery of directing intelligent systems to build complex software.
